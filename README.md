# YouFind - Dive into Data

## Latest version (complete package) is in main (folder NewTheme).

- Documentation for Backend (for AutoConverter) is in branch AutoConverter.

- For the e-mail-verification-function you have to set up the config.ini in branch email-verify-branch.
  - Since our VuFind runs on a local server, it could not send real emails to users.
  - To test it, you have to install a tool that emulates emails locally.
  - For this we used Mailhog: you can set config.ini to localhost:8025 and type in any email to test it.
